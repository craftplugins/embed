Craft CMS plugin that extracts information about web pages, like Youtube videos, Twitter statuses or blog articles.

## Usage

Embed comes with two methods for extracting information from links; Fields, which can be included in control panel entry types, and a plugin service, which can be used in both templates and other plugins.

#### Field

Links entered into the Embed field are validated.

```twig
{{ entry.embedField.html }}
```

Here are the default properties provided:

* type
* version
* url
* title
* description
* authorName
* authorUrl
* providerName
* providerUrl
* cacheAge
* thumbnailUrl
* thumbnailWidth
* thumbnailHeight
* html
* width
* height

#### Templates

The same properties are made available via the template variable and plugin service.

Below is an example for extracting embed code from a YouTube link, including styling to ensure itâ€™s responsive.

```twig
{% set info = craft.embed.extract('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPoHPNeU9fc') %}

<div class="responsive">
  {{ info.html }}{# Outputs whatever HTML has been extracted #}
</div>

{# Calculate ratio for padding #}
{% set ratio = (info.height|default(9) / info.width|default(16)) %}

<style>
  .responsive {
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: {{ ratio * 100 }}%;
  }
  .responsive > * {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style>
```
